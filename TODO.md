### Generic
* Sample uniformly from all classes like in the paper


### Models

#### WRN
* Run Wide Res Net code to try to get similar results to Oyallon et al
* Adapt WideResNet to have the same parameters as Oyallon et all (depth 16, width 8)

#### RN
* Implement a ResNet-like architecture, maybe by looking into https://gist.github.com/JefferyRPrice/c1ecc3d67068c8d9b3120475baba1d7e

### Guidelines
* Understand what exactly needs to be done for the project.
