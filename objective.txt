CIFAR10: small data: between 10^2 and 10^3 small natural images should be used to predict the labels of 10^4 images ; reference paper: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01495734/document
The goal of this project is to build a competitive algorithm to benchmark CIFAR10 in a limited samples situations. It means one should only use a subset of the dataset to predict the correct labels of the test set. This kind of techniques have applications in the industry, for example in the case of medical imaging where few annotated samples are available since they are expensive to produce. A good plot for this project, could be to study a (standard) convolutional architecture and then to try to improve the obtained results with software like scikit-learn. While this project seems purely empirical, a specific attention should be brought to understand the involved techniques, and also, the procedure to report the results.
